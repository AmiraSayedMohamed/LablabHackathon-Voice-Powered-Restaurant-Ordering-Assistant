![Alt text]([https://example.com/image.jpg](https://github.com/AmiraSayedMohamed/LablabHackathon-Voice-Powered-Restaurant-Ordering-Assistant/blob/master/appImage.jpg))

A voice-powered restaurant ordering web application built with Streamlit, leveraging AI and real-time audio processing to provide a seamless and interactive dining experience. Users can place orders via voice or text, explore a dynamic menu, and receive personalized recommendations powered by Groq's Llama AI model.

## Features

- **Voice-Activated Ordering**: Speak orders using a microphone or upload audio files (WAV, MP3, M4A), transcribed via Google's Speech-to-Text API.
- **Interactive Menu**: Browse a visually appealing menu with categories (burgers, pizza, appetizers, salads), including prices, descriptions, and dietary badges (vegetarian, vegan, spicy).
- **AI Recommendations**: Groq's Llama AI suggests upsells, promotions (e.g., Combo Deal), and complementary items based on user inputs and order history.
- **Real-Time Order Management**: View and modify the cart, adjust quantities, and see a detailed summary with subtotal, tax, and total.
- **Conversational Interface**: Engage with a friendly AI assistant through a chat interface, displaying conversation history with styled user and agent messages.
- **LiveKit Integration**: Real-time audio communication for voice-based ordering using LiveKit's WebRTC capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit**: Web interface for the application.
- **Groq API (Llama AI)**: Natural language processing for intent recognition and recommendations.
